    "2.If it goes from one point to another on a different face, \n",

    "The beetle is a student of Cartesian geometry, \n",
    "and knows the coordinates (x, y, z) of all the points it needs to go to.  \n",
    "The origin of coordinates it uses is one corner of the cube on the ground, and the z axis points up.  \n",
    "Hence, the bottom surface (on which it does not crawl) is z=0, and the top surface is z=10.  \n",
    "The beetle keeps track of all the distances travelled, and rounds the distance travelled to two decimal places once it reaches the next spot, \n",
